<h1>NICELY DONE! NICE NICE NICE</h1>

<p>if you are seeing this in the browser, that means your web server is working properly.</p>

<p>the address bar should be http://localhost/ect2200/index.html</p>

<p>it should NOT be file://......</p>

<p>if it's the latter, then the web server is not being used, but the file is being directly accessed. try typing in: http://localhost/ect2200/index.html</p>

<p>make sure the web server (MAMP) is turned on and the ect2200 folder is in the /web folder, and the /web folder is the web server root (set in the MAMP preferences).</p>
